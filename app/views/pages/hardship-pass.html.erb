<h1>Hardship Pass</h1>

  <p>A hardship pass allows you to be exempt from volunteer jobs for one session. You can request a hardship pass if you have been a member for three or more sessions, you are facing an unusual amount of stressors in your life, and you are unable to contribute by doing any volunteer jobs.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>After having volunteered 3 sessions, a family is eligible to request a Hardship Pass.</li>
    <li>At most, we can accommodate two families per session.</li>
    <li>Hardship Passess are available on a first come, first served basis.</li>
    <li>To request a Hardship Pass, please contact any board member.  Details are not required and your privacy is paramount.  The board will review and respond to the request within 7 days at the most.</li>
    <li>Our ability to offer hardship passes is limited.  If you find you are unable to contribute the session just after having utilized a hardship pass, we need you to take some time off until you can contribute once again.  This enables other families to utilize passes.</li>
    <li>There is a list of off-site jobs that need to be done each session. If you are finding that doing volunteer shifts while you are at CUCO is challenging, there is the possibility of meeting your volunteer requirement with these off-site jobs.</li>
  </ul>
