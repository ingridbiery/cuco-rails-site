<p>If you drop out before class fees are due, you are entitled to a 100% refund of your membership fee. If you drop out between when class fees are due and the day before the second class, you will receive a 50% refund of your membership fee. If you drop any time after the second class, we will not be able to refund your membership fee. After class fees are paid, they are refundable at the discretion of the teacher. If teachers have already bought materials or made plans, it is unfair to expect them to provide a refund.</p>
