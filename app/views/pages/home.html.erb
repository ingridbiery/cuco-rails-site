  <h1>Columbus Unschoolers Cooperative</h1>

  <h3>
We are a family-centered group whose members seek to support each other and augment our childrenâ€™s educational and social enrichment opportunities in a supportive, nurturing, hands-on classroom environment. 
<br /><br />
All parents whose children take classes serve in volunteer roles to make the program a success. Our co-op is composed of a diverse range of families, and we request that members respect the diversity of the group.
<br /><br />
The one thing we have in common is an interest in trying to do what is best for our children and our families. We are committed to maintaining unschooling principles while participating in co-op. We are open to all families willing to follow our behavior code and participation requirements.
