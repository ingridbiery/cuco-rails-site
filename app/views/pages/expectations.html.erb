<h2>CUCO’s Expectations of Members:</h2>
<ul>
<li>We expect all members to treat each other, our location and its staff equally and strive to leave things better than we found them.</li>

<li>We expect members to watch out for each other and help where needed. For example smaller children may need help getting to their destination.</li>

<li>We expect a reminder and gentle redirection if someone is not following the rules; if that is not enough, talk with the person and/or the person’s adult about your concern, board members are also available to help.</li>

<li>We expect members to be mindful and use gentle and kind words with each other; if there is disagreement to be respectful and ask for help from adults or friends if needed to find a solution.</li>

<li>We expect members to use the <%= link_to 'concern resolution process', page_path("concern-process") %> if they don’t feel they can fix a problem on their own.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Rules:</h2>
<ul>
<li>A child cannot be outside alone. If there’s not an adult at the playground it is closed until one is found.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Information:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Anyone who has attended more than one session of co-op, including kids, can teach a class. Help is available to anyone, adult or child, who plans to teach a class. Be sure to ask for the support you need.</li>
</ul>
