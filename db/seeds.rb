It\'s a wild, fun adventure, and even if you\'ve never considered writing a novel before, it\'s a great time to give it a try.
This class is a chance for NaNoWrimo participants to come and work on their novels, and to talk with other WriMos (as we call ourselves) about their noveling triumphs and challenges. Bring a laptop or pen and paper, whichever is your preferred method of pulling words from your brain.
The NaNo challenge is only during the month of November, but participants are welcome to continue working on their novels after that time, or to begin the work of revising and editing their novels. Participants could also share their novels (complete or not) with others in the class.
Signing up for the official NaNo challenge is optional. Participants also aren\'t required to work on a novel... short stories would be just fine, too.

From Lilit:
Steampunk is a subgenre of science fiction literature. It is usually depicted in an alternate reality that uses machinery powered by steam during the Victorian era. The steampunk fashion consists of gears, bolts, cogs and other trinkets used in machines. In “Steampunk It” you will bring items you would like to decorate so it looks steampunk’d. These items could be anything from welding goggles to a nerf gun to a jacket.
We will be painting, spray painting, filing, taking things apart, putting things back together (hopefully), sewing, and gluing throughout “Steampunk It”.
We will all be learning together about what we can do to Steampunk items as we go.
For an example of a steampunk\'d Nerf gun look here-

Perched at the edge of civilized lands, the small town of Falcon\'s Hollow has always had to rely on itself to solve its problems. Meanwhile, the uncaring lumber barons squeeze the common folk for every last copper, deaf to their pleas. Now the hacking coughs of the sick are heard throughout town. The plague has come to Falcon\'s Hollow and the town\'s leaders can\'t be bothered to stop it.
This is a pre-generated adventure. We\'ll create characters on the first day then start the adventure the second day and play the rest of the days until we either save Falcon\'s Hollow or fail.
One does not need to know how to read fluently in order to play. As long as one has an imagination and patience, one can play.
Patience is required as sometimes the game master needs to look something up or calculate something. Also, this is a turn-based game so being willing to wait patiently for one\'s turn will also be helpful.
There may be killing and death to the characters in the game, both the player characters and the non-player characters. Since the focus of the adventure is on finding a cure for the plague, characters are at risk of both getting the plague themselves and/or their non-player character family/friends may get the plague. So, even though the class is open to all ages, folks (both parents and children) should feel comfortable talking about and role-playing death and sickness.
We\'ll try to keep gender and other oppression completely out of the adventure, however, the adventure has already been generated so it may not be perfect.
