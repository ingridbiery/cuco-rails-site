getting to know the herbs selected through discussion and keeping
information on note cards that they will add to as the course progresses.
Responsibility is a lesson as well, with each kid remembering to bring
items back to class.
Each subsequent class will delve into brewing, formulating, and learning
different ways to incorporate herbs into everyday uses such as in honeys,
oils and beverages. We will be using the principles of weight, measurement
and eye-balling it (The Simpler Method). Math, and a little science
will be covered.
Discussions among participants is encouraged to reach a
good understanding of the subjects/projects. Every student will get to
experience each herb, oil, vinegar, honey, by touching, watching, tasting,
feeling and storing all aspects of their hands-on learning.

Disc golf is played exactly like golf, except we use frisbees instead of golf clubs and balls. We will be using the grounds of the rec center as our course, with trees and other natural & man-made targets as our holes.
This class is open to all ages and students under the age of 6 will need an adult escort.
This is an exclusively outdoor class so students need to dress for the weather.
Students will need to bring their own equipment. Genuine golf discs are best but any recreational frisbee will also work. Anyone interested in keeping score will need to bring something to write with and score cards will be provided.
If anyone is interested, I have worked out a deal with the owner of a local disc golf store where he will provide members of our co-op with an Innova Shark golf disc for $6.00 plus tax (these sell for about $10.00 online).
